Categories, custom categories
DataBase
option to choose when is the start of the week.
refactor :
statistics yearly will go automatically to 2020 no need for hard coding.
satistics to navigate from weekly the whole week every week from all the data
same to month.
async and ajax for income and expense page also statistics when clicked on random button will async the div.
put only 10 items per screen on income and expense and an arrow to go back and forward.
if there is no data display the same message when clicked on weekly monthly yearly.

refactor all the variables into one in each function like so :const blld,glglf,vlflf,fkfkf;

format nav icons ahref etc
